Switching to Django for the Authentication & User Management System is a great choice, as Django offers a robust and scalable framework with built-in features for user management. Here's an overview of what you can include in your Django-based project:

### Key Features for Django-Based Authentication & User Management System

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Utilize Django's built-in user authentication system.
   - Implement custom user models if you need additional fields.
   - Support for social logins using `django-allauth` or similar libraries.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Implement groups and permissions to manage user access levels.

3. **JWT Authentication:**
   - Use `djangorestframework-jwt` or `django-rest-framework-simplejwt` for secure token-based authentication.

4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
   - Implement 2FA using libraries like `django-otp` or custom solutions.

5. **Password Management:**
   - Features for password reset, password change, and password strength validation.

6. **User Profile Management:**
   - Allow users to update profiles, upload avatars, and manage settings.

7. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Utilize Django's powerful admin interface for managing users, roles, and permissions.

8. **Email Notifications:**
   - Set up email backend for sending verification, password recovery, and other notifications.

9. **Comprehensive API:**
   - Implement a RESTful API using Django REST Framework (DRF) for integration with front-end applications.

10. **Additional Features:**
    - Activity logs, device tracking, and account security settings.

### Advantages of Using Django

- **Built-In Features:** Django comes with a built-in user authentication system, admin interface, and support for user sessions, making it easier to implement user management functionalities.
- **Security:** Django follows best practices for security, including protection against common vulnerabilities like CSRF, XSS, and SQL injection.
- **Scalability:** Django's structure and features allow for scalable development, making it suitable for projects of all sizes.
- **Community Support:** A strong community and extensive documentation make it easier to find support and resources.

### Development Steps

1. **Setup:** Set up a Django project and create a custom user model if needed.
2. **User Authentication:** Implement registration, login, logout, and password management functionalities.
3. **Permissions and Roles:** Set up groups and permissions for different user roles.
4. **API Development:** Use Django REST Framework to build a comprehensive API.
5. **Admin Interface:** Customize Django's admin interface to manage users and other aspects of the system.
6. **Testing & Documentation:** Thoroughly test all features and provide clear documentation.
